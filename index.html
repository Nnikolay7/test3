        Hello! My name is Mykola Nikiforov, I am 32 years old and I would like to become a student of your school under the IT Generation program. I chose the Front-End direction, because I like to immediately see the result of my work. Now I am actively learning JS on my own. But I feel like I still need more to structure my existing knowledge, close gaps, learn new things, have a good mentor.      </p>
      <p>Here the options on how you can reach me:
